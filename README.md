# A2-Sudoku


In this collaboration we will seek to solve a standard 9x9 sudoku using the AC-3 algorithm.

The data for the program is provided by text files and will need to be changed to run a different configuration. At the moment when run the program will initialize a board based on the information given by the text files, display the state of the board then attempt to solve the missing values using the AC-3 algorithm. If correctly solved it will display a valid solution otherwise it will display the state of the board up to the point that the algorithm could solve.
